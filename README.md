# VIODE
This is a repository for the VIODE (Visual-Inertial Odometry in Dynamic Environments) dataset described in the paper:  
Koji Minoda, Fabian Schilling, Valentin WÃ¼est, Dario Floreano, and Takehisa Yairi, "VIODE: A Simulated Dataset to Address the Challenges of Visual-Inertial Odometry in Dynamic Environments", IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), 2021.

The overall documentation is available in the above RA-L paper. 
The whole dataset is hosted on zenodo. 

# Dataset Structure
The visual-inertial sensor data is provided in ROS bag format. Each bag contains the following topics.
- /cam0/image_raw
- /cam1/image_raw
- /cam0/segmentation
- /cam1/segmentation
- /imu0
- /odometry

The first two topics contain RGB image data. Since these are captured in the simulator, we also provide ground-truth extrinsic and intrinsic parameters for this stereo setup.

The next two topics are the ground truth semantic segmentation provided by AirSim. 
The ex-/intrinsic parameters are the same as the ones with the RGB images. 
We also provide rgb_id.txt which contains the correspondence between object ID and RGB value in segmentation images.

The other files are
- calibration.txt
- rgb_id.txt

The calibration.txt provides extrinsic and intrinsic parameters of two cameras.
The rgb_id.txt provides the correspondence between object ID and RGB value in segmentation images.
